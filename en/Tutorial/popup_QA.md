## Common Issues

### Transfer Payment

### What should I do if the wallet does not open after white screen?
1.	Make sure to use the latest version of the SERO Popup wallet community, download link: https://sero.cash/app/popup.html
2.	Check whether the mobile phone network is normal.
The account balance is sufficient, but what happens if the error shows balance is insufficient?
To send transactions continuously, because of the characteristics of SERO's account model, you need to ensure that the number of available UTXO accounts is sufficient.

### What should I do if the sending transaction fails or reports an error?
1.	Check if the data is synchronized, you can view the synchronization log, "My">>"Settings">>"Check Sync Status", if there is a print log, and there are: "AddTx", "Fetch", "Remove" and other logs, indicating that account data is being synchronized, just keep the wallet running in the front end (switching to the background or exiting will interrupt synchronization) until the block is synchronized to the latest height.
2.	Check if the transaction gas fee (SERO) is sufficient.

### What should I do if the tokens disappear after importing the wallet?
1.	Check if the mobile phone network is normal.
2.	Check the node settings, "My">>"Settings">>"Node Settings", use "Node 2 (Mainland China)" in Mainland China, and "Node 1 (Global)" in other regions.
3.	Check the synchronization log, "My">>"Settings">>" Check Sync Status", if there is a print log, and there are: "AddTx", "Fetch", "Remove" and other logs, indicating that the account is synchronizing data, just keep the wallet running in the front end (switching to the background or quitting will interrupt synchronization) until the block is synchronized to the latest height.

### Account data display incorrect, how to repair the data?
1.	To repair data for a single account, click "..." in the upper right corner of the wallet to enter "Wallet Management", click the "Repair Data" button, and then keep the wallet running in the front end (switching to the background or exiting will interrupt synchronization) until the block Sync to the latest height.
2.	During the synchronization process, you can view the synchronization log, "My">>" Settings">>"Check Sync Status", if there is a print log, and there are: "AddTx", "Fetch", "Remove" and other logs, indicating that the account is syncing data. If the account has more transactions, the synchronization time will be longer, hence be patient.
3.	You can also use "My">>"Settings">>"Clear App Data". Note that this function is to clear the data of all accounts. It may take a long time to synchronize all accounts.

### What if I send to the wrong address?
After the transfer is successful, the currency has reached the collection address then transaction cannot be cancelled. If you accidentally fill in the wrong payment address when transferring money, we suggest that you contact the other party and negotiate the transfer back.
*Tips:*
If the address you filled in is copied from the exchange or other platform, please contact the customer service of the exchange or other platform directly to appeal.
