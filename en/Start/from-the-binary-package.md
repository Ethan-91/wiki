# Mining using Gero

This article mainly explains how to install SERO from binary package and use it to mine SERO coins. For more information, please visit our [Product Technology WIKI](https://wiki.sero.cash).

# Bonus Design

SERO issued a total of 1 billion SERO coins, of which 25 % were awarded as community node contributions, that is, 250 million SERO coins were awarded to SERO miners for mining.  Mining bonus follow these rules:

* ### Bonus will be issued within 10 years, and a certain amount of SERO coins will be mined each year until 250 million SERO coins are mined.

   > **Because the initial SERO community network capacity is still relatively small, we use this strategy:**

   > * 250 million SERO coins are used as a bonus pool, when the miners succeed in generating a block, the corresponding SERO coins will be drawn from the bonus pool as a reward according to the rules.
   > * After each generation of 2,100,000 blocks, the bonus is reduced by about 1.4 times.
   > * In order to encourage miners to package more transactions, the consensus will compare the `gas usage' of the two blocks before and after.
   >     * $\frac{4}{5}$ for the block bonus when the current block consumes less than or equal to the previous block.
   >     * When the block consumption gas is greater than the previous one, you can get an extra bonus for the block reward $\frac{2}{5}$.
   > * To ensure fairness when the capacity of nodes is small, we set an initial difficulty value.
   >     * If the difficulty of generating block is less than the initial value, the bonus will be given in proportion to the initial difficulty.
   >     * If the difficulty of the block is greater than or equal to the initial value, the bonus will be paid according to the full amount.
   > * The above rules will work at the same time.

* ### Starting from the Betanet-Release version, mines will be mined with the POW consensus. At that time, the SERO tokens on it will be mapped to Main Net by 1:1, and the distribution of node maintenance bonus on the Main Net will follow the SE-Random consensus.

   > **The Versions of BetaNet**
   > * RC version: Betanet's release in release candidate will require several versions of adjustments from the official Betanet, the ledger will be cleared after the release of the RC version.
   >
   > * Release version: The official version of BetaNet will be deployed at 24:00 on January 7, 2019. The ledger will not be cleared when subsequent versions are updated.
   >
   >   `Originally scheduled for December 31, 2018, due to the influence of Christmas and New Year's Day, we feel that we are delaying for one week.`


# The steps mining operation

## 1. Install SERO

> **There are two options for you to install SERO on your own computer**

> * One is to install the `all-node service program (gero)` and operate the `gero` through the `command line console`.
> * The other is to install the wallet directly and operate it through the GUI interface.
>
> **`Note: This article only explains how to install the gero service from the "binary package" released by SERO.`**

> **If you want to install `gero` from `source`, please refer to**
>
> * [From Source Code -- base on CentOS7](https://wiki.sero.cash/zh/index.html?file=Start/from-the-sourcecode-base-on-centos7)
>
> **If you want to install `wallet`, please refer to**
>
> * [SERO Tutorial -- Wallet Manual](https://wiki.sero.cash/zh/index.html?file=Tutorial/manual-of-wallet)

* ### **Download the latest version of `gero` binary package via github.**
   Readers can download the latest binary package by visiting the link [https://github.com/sero-cash/go-sero/releases](https://github.com/sero-cash/go-sero/releases).

   ![image.png](http://sero-media.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images/jianshu/277023-b731e437b567c179.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/600)

   > **In the Assets section, you can see the binary packages for different system environments**
   > * `gero-[VERSION]-darwin-amd64.tar.gz` corresponds to the 64-bit `MacOS` system
   > * `gero-[VERSION]-linux-amd64-v3.tar.gz` corresponds to 64-bit `linux3` kernel system
   > * `gero-[VERSION]-linux-amd64-v4.tar.gz` corresponds to the 64-bit `linux4` kernel system
   > * `gero-v0.3.1-beta.rc.5-windows-amd64.zip` corresponds to 64-bit `WIN7/WIN8/WIN10` system
   >
   > **When BetaNet-RC5 is released**
   > * The latest `Ubuntu & CentOS7` distribution defaults to the `Linux3` kernel.
   > * The latest `Fedora` distribution defaults to the `Linux4` kernel.
   >
   > **`Note: This article is based on the CentOS system, and other systems are similar in the use of binary packages. `**

    Take the binary package corresponding to CentOS7 as an example, first download it:

   ```sh
   $ pwd
   /root
   ```

   ```sh
   $ wget https://github.com/sero-cash/go-sero/releases/download/v0.3.1-beta.rc.5/gero-v0.3.1-beta.rc.5-linux-amd64-v3.tar.gz
   ```

   ```sh
   $ ls
   gero-v0.3.1-beta.rc.5-linux-amd64-v3.tar.gz
   ```

   ```sh
   $ tar -xvf gero-v0.3.1-beta.rc.5-linux-amd64-v3.tar.gz
   $ ls
   geropkg gero-v0.3.1-beta.rc.5-linux-amd64-v3.tar.gz
   ```

   `geropkg` is the directory that extracts the binary program. Let's see what's inside:

   ```sh
   $ ls geropkg
   attach.sh  bin  clean.sh  czero  startup.sh  stop.sh
   ```

   > **Description of each file:**
   >
   > * `czero` is the zero knowledge proofs library of SERO
   > * `bin` has SERO's main program gero in it
   > * `startup.sh` is the service startup script
   > * `stop.sh` is the service stop script
   > * `attach.sh` is the console startup script
   > * `clean.sh` is the script to clear the account data
   >     * **Note: ** After execution, the keystore directory will not be cleared, but the ledger data will be resynchronized.

* ### **Determine `datadir`**

   > * The first important directory of SERO is `datadir`, which stores synchronized account data.
   > * Another important directory is `keystore`, which contains the encrypted `account file` and the `license file` for minning, like this:
   >
   >   ![image.png](http://sero-media.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images/jianshu/277023-d8801c3d87c486e5.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

   In order not to affect the synchronized data when upgrading `geropkg` in the future, we separate the data directory, such as:

   ```sh
   $ mkdir .sero-data
   $ ls -a
   . .. .sero-data geropkg gero-v0.3.1-beta.rc.5-linux-amd64-v3.tar.gz
   ```

* ### **Start `gero`**

   Execute `startup.sh` to start `gero`

   > **startup parameters of `startup.sh`**
   > ```sh
   > ./startup.sh [--datadir DATA_DIR] [--keystore KEYSTORE_DIR]
   > ```
   > Where `DATA_DIR` is used to specify the `datadir` location, and `KEYSTORE_DIR` is used to specify the location of the `keystore` directory.
   >
   > **This script follows the rules below**
   >
   > * If `keystore` is not specified, `gero` will create it under `datadir` by default.
   > * If `datadir` is not specified, `gero` will create it in the user's home directory by default.

   **Let's enter the `geropkg` directory and make sure it has a log file directory**

   ```sh
   $ cd geropkg
   $ mkdir log
   $ ls
   attach.sh  bin  clean.sh  czero  log  startup.sh  stop.sh
   ```

   **Then execute the `startup.sh` script**

   ```sh
   $ startup.sh --datadir "../sero-data"
   /root/geropkg/czero/lib/
   /root/geropkg/bin/gero --datadir=../datadir --port 60602
   ```

   **We can check `log` to determine if `gero` is working properly**

   ```sh
   $ tail -f log/gero.log
   ```

   **You will see text similar to the following**

   ![image.png](http://sero-media.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images/jianshu/277023-8397a48ee35318a9.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/600)

   As long as you see the text `IPC endpoint opened`, the startup is successful.

## 2. Create Account

* ### **Start console**
   Start the console by executing `attach.sh`
   > **Startup parameters of `attach.sh`**
   > ```sh
   > ./attach.sh [DATA_DIR]
   > ```
   > where `DATA_DIR` is used to specify the location of `datadir` when gero is started. If not specified, gero will look for `datadir` in the default location.

   ```sh
   $./attach.sh "../sero-data"
   ```

   If you see a console interface similar to the one below, the console will start successfully.

   ![image.png](http://sero-media.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images/jianshu/277023-9511643359456b35.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/600)

* ### **Create account**
   Now we can create an account by typing the command below:

   **`Note: The greo console supports pressing [TAB] to complete the command`**

   ```JavaScript
   > personal.newAccount("123456")
   "4GYNYzECNovCniXiYi1VV58vk97U1vWF7KfSRJCTFVv95kbdVhWYX4kjkcYBpw2zzfDZfaeEqB8YhANGDGFkG3SP"
   ```
   Set the password in the `newAccount` function input. Please remember the password. If you lose it, you will lose control of the account and cannot retrieve it. The return value is the public key address `PK` of the created account.

   > `PK` can be safely given to the other party as a transfer receiving address

   If you want to view the account created by this node, you can call the following command to get the public key of all accounts:

   ```JavaScript
   > sero.accounts
   ["4GYNYzECNovCniXiYi1VV58vk97U1vWF7KfSRJCTFVv95kbdVhWYX4kjkcYBpw2zzfDZfaeEqB8YhANGDGFkG3SP"]
   ```

   For security, if the account is not used for 5 minutes after it is created, it will be locked. If the account is locked, you need to enter a password to unlock the account.

   ```JavaScript
   > sero.sendTransaction(...)
   Error: authentication needed: password or unlock
   
   > personal.unlockAccount(sero.accounts[0],"123456")
   true
   ```

   > Note: The bonus from mining will default to the account created by the current node, which is the account represented by `sero.accounts[0]`.

   The command to exit the console is:

   ```JavaScript
    > exit
   ```

## 3. Install Mining License

* You don't need a license anymore.

## 4. Start Mining

Now we can start mining happily, let us enter the console again, and then start mining:

```JavaScript
> miner.start()
```

The command to stop mining:

```JavaScript
> miner.stop()
```

To see if mining is in progress:
```JavaScript
> sero.mining
true
```
> return `true` to indicate that mining is under way

View the current block height:

```JavaScript
> sero.blockNumber
32165
```

See if you've mined SERO coins:

```JavaScript
> sero.getBalance(sero.accounts[0])
{
  tkn: {
    SERO: 2.03085359120665e+22
  }
}
```

The above unit is `Ta` (1 SERO = $10^{18}$ Ta), converted to `SERO` coins can be called:
```JavaScript
> web3.fromTa(2.03085359120665e+22)
"20308.5359120665"
```
