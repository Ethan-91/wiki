# Suspension of SERO Guild Mining Program and launch of Hybrid PoW&PoS Consensus

Dear SEO Community,

In view of the fact that the SERO blockchain will adopt the Hybrid PoW+PoS consensus in the June release of the mainnet version, the new consensus mechanism will encourage SERO coin holders as PoS nodes compared to the PoW nodes with hardware inputs. Obtaining more online nodes will result in more efficient network stability. Under the PoW+PoS consensus mechanism, the PoW computing power is responsible for the block generation and the PoS determines the legality/validity of the block through the collateral voting mechanism. In this way, the generation and validation of each block is done by the miners and stakers and the two checks and balances each other thus avoiding the monopoly of either party. In addition, through the voting mechanism of PoS, it is possible to effectively suppress the hard fork of the block network.

Therefore, the SERO Guild Mining Program will be suspended and the new reward events will be shared soon. We really appreciate all the miners that took part in SERO Guild Mining Program and made it a successful event.

The SERO journey is just getting started as we inch towards the June mainnet launch. Many more rewarding  events and opportunities to come.
