# SERO Mine Pool Awards  No. 004 Announcement

The SERO Mine Pool Awards  No. 004 are announced as follows 
(Note: Only the list of qualified mines will be announced this time)

In addition, the SERO consensus has been smoothly switched to progPOW. The GPU mining has been carried out smoothly. The original 5% reward pool plan is returned to the miner's income i.e, the original token distribution mining revenue is upgraded to 80% and the project team officially announced the mining pool. 

SERO mainnet will be launched very soon and we're very excited to see SERO Ecology growing!
<br>Thanks to the all mine owners for their support of the SERO project. We really appreciate it!
