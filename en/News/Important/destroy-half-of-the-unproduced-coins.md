#SERO is about to destroy half of the unproduced coins

SERO has passed community and foundation resolutions in the evening of 2020.2.18, respectively, announcing that the remaining half of the unproduced tokens will be destroyed. SERO's consensus is a PoW / PoS hybrid consensus. The volume is 800 million pieces, and the total output needs to be divided into 101 years to complete the entire output. Considering that the current theoretical mining output has reached about 180 million pieces, which means that the remaining 620 million will be destroyed by 310 million. Due to the difficulty of computing power, more than 40 million Tokens have actually been destroyed. Therefore, the theoretical total of SERO will be sharply reduced from 1 billion to 650 million! And the entire output cycle will be adjusted to 97 years.
