# SERO Mine Pool 004 Reward Program (Tentative)

In order to build the SERO community ecology and encourage more computing power to join the public pool, the SERO project team has decided to provide certain support incentives for the SERO mining pools. In current cycle(004), 5000SERO/mining pool  will be rewarded if the number of blocks mined by a mining pool reaches 3,000 and if the number of blocks in the pool reaches 8,000 plus, then an additional 10,000 SERO will be awarded.
