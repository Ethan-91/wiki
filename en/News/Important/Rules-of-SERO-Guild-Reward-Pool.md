# Rules of SERO Guild Reward Pool (5%) to be redesigned

SERO's token economic mechanism is designed to share 80% of the supply among miners and 5% of it is reserved for the guild organization formed by the miners. For the past three months, the guilds have been ranked by the mining hashpower of all members of the guild. Three rounds of guild rewards distribution have been completed so far (in 3 months) and today we have decided to make an important adjustment to this part of the guild's reward distribution system.

The reason for this adjustment of the part of the award is mainly because we will remove the need of the mining license in the foreseeable short-term and completely open the mining as SERO was initially designed. After removing the license in addition to the limited range of the mine pool, it will not be possible to count the mining output of any miners so it would not be possible to distribute the reward according to the mining hashpower.

Another important reason is that SERO is rapidly expanding its ecological cooperation at this stage, including community building, ecological application development, exchange/media cooperation in various regions of the world etc., to further position SERO as the leader of privacy eco-consensus-to global outreach. Therefore, the project team will define a series of goal-oriented tasks to reward the various guild organizations and with the corresponding prize pool share mentioned above as a reward, the specific tasks will be announced on the official website from time to time.

It is important to emphasize again that the guild bounty scheme is still tied to the guild organization. Any participant must be registered as a guild and will be rewarded and distributed by the guild owner.
