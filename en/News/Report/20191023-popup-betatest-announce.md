# SERO Decentralized Mobile Wallet (Popup) Public Test Announcement



Popup wallet is a decentralized mobile wallet designed for the SERO ecosystem. Popup can directly connect any SERO's full-node service program gero, doesn't rely on the centralized server and will not send any information generated locally by users to the centralized server.



### Today's release of `v1.0.0` currently covers only the following key features:



1. Import and export mnemonics

2. Account selection

3. Multiple assets balance analysis
